title: ChoiceRank
---

<p>
<strong>ChoiceRank</strong> is an algorithm that estimates the <em>transition
probabilities</em> along the edges of a network based on the networks's
<em>structure</em> and on the <em>traffic</em> at each node of the network. For
example, it can be used to estimate the probability of users clicking on any
link of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(paper)">Wikipedia
page</a>, given a hyperlink graph (such as <a
href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/enwiki-2013.html">this one</a>) and the <a
href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=latest-20&pages=Page_(paper)">number
of views</a> each page got.

<p>The algorithm and the underlying model are described in the following

<p>There are two implementations of ChoiceRank available at the moment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python</strong>: the <a
href="https://github.com/lucasmaystre/choix">choix</a> library provides an
implementation that is well-tested an easy to use, and that scales seamlessly
to graphs containing up to a few million nodes. Check out <a
href="https://github.com/lucasmaystre/choix/blob/master/notebooks/choicerank-tutorial.ipynb">this
Jupyter notebook</a> to get started.</li>
<li><strong>Rust</strong>: for very large graphs, there is an <a
href="https://github.com/lucasmaystre/COST/tree/choicerank">experimental
implementation</a> of ChoiceRank written in Rust that is computationally very
efficient (it is based on Frank McSherry's code for <a
href="http://www.frankmcsherry.org/graph/scalability/cost/2015/01/15/COST.html">COST</a>).
Documentation is a bit lacking at the moment, drop me a line if you need
help!</li>
</ul>
